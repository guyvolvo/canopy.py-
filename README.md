Canopy is a Python-based OSINT framework designed to help individuals discover, organize, and analyze publicly available information about their own digital footprint.
Canopy was developed and tested exclusively on my own publicly available data as a learning and portfolio project.

# Project Goals

- Understand how publicly available information is indexed and exposed online
- Practice structured OSINT methodology using search engines
- Correlate results from multiple sources into meaningful categories
- Demonstrate ethical boundaries and legal awareness in OSINT work

### _Legal & Ethical Disclaimer_

##### This framework is intended strictly for self-OSINT, educational use, or explicit consent-based research.
##### This tool should be used to analyze:
- Your own digital footprint
- Accounts, domains, and identifiers you own
- Targets for which you have explicit written permission
- Using this tool against private individuals without consent may violate privacy laws and platform Terms of Service.
- I have no responsibility for misuse of this software.

_Canopy collects metadata only, such as:_
- Page titles
- URLs
- Search snippets
- Source domain

_It does not:_
- Bypass CAPTCHAs
- Scrape authenticated content
- Harvest private data
- Enumerate personal contact lists
